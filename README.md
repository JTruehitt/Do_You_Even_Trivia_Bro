# Trivia Game
We're working on the title

## Description

MVP: It's a quiz game with multiple choice (text) questions that draws from two APIs - generic trivia fact databases.

Stretch goals: Add 5 or more different types of questions and draw trivia facts from more specific databases for movies, music, etc.

## User Story

A nerdy person or group of friends wants to test their knowledge of literature, history, geography, movies, music, sports, and more to have fun and socialize.
When the user opens the Trivia Game, then they are given the choice to start a regular game or choose some settings (game length, exclude certain question categories, e.g.)
When the user starts the game, then they are shown one of three or more different types of questions - multiple choice (text), multiple choice (image), short answer,etc.
When the user answers a question correctly, they are congratulated and shown the next question. 
When the user answers a question incorrectly, they are shown the correct answer and shown the next question. 
When the user has answered all the questions (7-21, perhaps), then they are shown their score and given the option to save the result to a high scoreboard with local storage.
